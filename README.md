## A machine capable of looking at itself?!

Turing machines are fascinating.
With the right idea in mind and a modicum of patience, we can encode any machine as a symbol-string, load it into a "universal" machine's tape, hit _go_ and watch the host machine perfectly emulate its input machine, state-for-state, step-by-step in a sort of Quinean dream that would make even the staunchest naysayers grin.

Aside from being fascinating, Turing machines are just plain fun.
This is an attempt to provide an easy-to-use sandbox for creating, debugging, and running small Turing machines.
Enjoy!

## Thanks

To Alan M. Turing, a human being way ahead of their time in more ways than one.

Prof. Kevin Treu, who introduced me to Turing and computation not once but _twice_: first when I was a freshman, and second when I was a senior.
Many thanks, Dr. Treu; I couldn't think of a better way to book-end a college career!
