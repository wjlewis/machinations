      Machine with the <span class="tm-name">tm</span> application. For a

      <h2>What we'll create</h2>
      <p>
        This guide will walk you through the process of creating a Turing
        Machine that decides the formal language
        <code>A<sup>n</sup>B<sup>n</sup>C<sup>n</sup></code>. That is, we will
        construct a machine that <i>accepts</i> all strings consisting of a
        number of <code>A</code>s followed by the same number of
        <code>B</code>s followed by the same number of <code>C</code>s, and
        <i>rejects</i> all other strings.
      </p>

      <h2>Constructing the machine</h2>
      <p>
        Before creating the machine, it might help to walk through a simple
        example in order to clarify our strategy. Let's consider the string
        <code>AAABBBCCC</code>. It's large enough to (hopefully) ensure that our
        design doesn't rely on special properties of small numbers, but small
        enough to work with by hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the core of a candidate procedure: whenever we read an
        <code>A</code>, we cross it out and scan to the right until we see a
        <code>B</code> (which we cross out), and then a <code>C</code> (which we
        also cross out). After completing this process, we scan to the left to
        the first uncrossed-out <code>A</code> and repeat. In this way, for
        every <code>A</code>, we also verify that there is a corresponding
        <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can illustrate this process with our sample string
        <code>AAABBBCCC</code>. We cross out the leftmost <code>A</code>, after
        which our string looks like
        <code><span class="crossed-out">A</span>AABBBCCC</code>. We then scan to
        the right until we see the first <span>B</span>, which we cross out,
        yielding
        <code><span class="crossed-out">A</span>AA<span class="crossed-out">B</span>BBCCC</code>.
        Finally, we scan to the first <code>C</code>, and cross it out, yielding
        <code><span class="crossed-out">A</span>AA<span class="crossed-out">B</span>BB<span class="crossed-out">C</span>CC</code>.
        Repeating this process once more from the left yields
        <code><span class="crossed-out">A</span><span class="crossed-out">A</span>A<span class="crossed-out">B</span><span class="crossed-out">B</span>B<span class="crossed-out">C</span><span class="crossed-out">C</span>C</code>
        We scan through the string one final time, crossing out the remaining
        <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>:
        <code><span class="crossed-out">A</span><span class="crossed-out">A</span><span class="crossed-out">A</span><span class="crossed-out">B</span><span class="crossed-out">B</span><span class="crossed-out">B</span><span class="crossed-out">C</span><span class="crossed-out">C</span><span class="crossed-out">C</span></code>
        We can now see that because every symbol in the string has been crossed
        out, and at no time did we cross out an <code>A</code> without also
        crossing out a <code>B</code> and a <code>C</code>, the string
        <code>AAABBBCCC</code> belongs to the language <code>A<sup>n</sup>B<sup>n</sup>C<sup>n</sup></code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're now ready to construct the state diagram for this machine. If
        you've navigated to the application (<a class="doc-link" href="./tm">wjlew.is/tm</a>),
        you should see a screen that looks like this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/fresh-open.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/fresh-open.png" alt="The application, freshly opened" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        Add a machine state by clicking the "add new state" button on the lefthand side.
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img class="img-sequence__item" src="./screenshots/add-new-state-button.png" alt="The 'add new state' button" />
      </div>

      <p>
        Clicking the "add new state" button does not actually add a new state.
        Instead, once you click the button, you can place the new state anywhere
        on the screen by clicking on the desired location.
      </p>

      <p>
        After adding the state, your screen should look something like this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/added-first-state.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/added-first-state.png" alt="After adding a state" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        Try adding another state next to the first:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/added-second-state.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/added-second-state.png" alt="After adding another state" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        As you can see, the first state is no longer colored purple. The purple
        coloring indicates that a state is currently selected. You can select a
        state by clicking it. Additionally, you can select multiple states at
        once by holding the SHIFT key and clicking the desired
        states.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's time to add a transition between the two states. Select the first
        one we added. Then, holding the SHIFT key down, select the second state.
        Some new options should appear on the lefthand side, including the "add
        transition" button:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img class="img-sequence__item" src="./screenshots/add-transition-button.png" alt="The 'add transition' button" />
      </div>

      <p>
        Click this button. It will add a line between the two states with an
        arrow pointing from the first one we selected toward the second:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/added-transition.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/added-transition.png" alt="After adding another state" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        Beside the arrow, you will see a pair of text inputs and an arrow
        symbol. Focus the first of the inputs and type the character <code>A</code>. Then
        focus the next input and type the character <code>a</code>:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/new-transition-with-symbols.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/new-transition-with-symbols.png" alt="After changing the read/write symbols for the transition" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        The first symbol is the "read" symbol for the transition and the second
        is the "write" symbol. When the machine is in the first state, it will
        follow the transition if the current symbol under the tape head matches
        the read symbol; when it follows the transition, it will replace the
        read symbol with the write symbol. Lastly, the arrow indicates the
        direction in which the tape will move when the machine follows the
        transition. In this case, the tape will move to the <i>left</i>
        (effectively scanning the tape head to the <i>right</i>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's see if this transition behaves the way I have described above. In
        order to try it out, we need to indicate the "initial state" of the
        machine. For the purposes of our little experiment, we will make the
        first state the start state. Simply select the first state, and click
        the "distinguish as initial state" button:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img class="img-sequence__item" src="./screenshots/distinguish-as-initial-state-button.png" alt="The 'distinguish as initial state' button" />
      </div>

      <p>
        Your machine should now resemble this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img class="img-sequence__item" src="./screenshots/after-distinguishing-initial.png" alt="After distinguishing a state as the initial state." />
      </div>

      <p>
        The arrow within the circle indicates that the state is the initial
        machine state: any time the machine is reset, it will start in this
        state. The yellow arrow indicates that the machine will be in this state
        whenever the simulation is started or resumed. Since we have not yet
        started the simulation, the yellow arrow points to the initial state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, we must type an <code>A</code> character in the first cell of the tape
        (otherwise, the machine will not follow our transition). Simply focus
        the leftmost tape cell and type the character <code>A</code>:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/tape-after-A.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/tape-after-A.png" alt="After typing the character 'A' in the first tape cell" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        Your machine should now resemble this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/before-first-test.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/before-first-test.png" alt="The machine, before our first test" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        Time to see if the machine follows the transition! Without further ado,
        press the "step" button located below the tape:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img class="img-sequence__item" src="./screenshots/step-button.png" alt="The simulation step button" />
      </div>

      <p>
        This will execute a single step in the machine's operation. The result
        should look something like this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/test-transition.gif">
          <img src="./screenshots/test-transition.gif" alt="Testing a transition" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        The machine read the character <code>A</code> under the tape head, replaced it with
        the character <code>a</code>, moved the tape to the left, and changed the current
        state.
      </p>

      <p>
        To return the machine to its original simulation state, click the
        "reset" button near the "step" button:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img class="img-sequence__item" src="./screenshots/reset-button.png" alt="The simulation reset button" />
      </div>

      <p>
        This will revert the tape contents to whatever they were before the
        simulation was started or stepped, and return the next simulation state
        to the initial state.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment, our machine does next to nothing. Let's add some
        additional states and transitions to create something closer to our
        desired <code>A<sup>n</sup>B<sup>n</sup>C<sup>n</sup></code> decider.
      </p>

      <p>
        After reading and "crossing out" (since we can't really cross out
        characters on the tape, we'll just replace them with their lower-case
        variants. This preserves their "type" while also indicating that they've
        been processed already) an <code>A</code>, we wish to scan through the
        remaining <code>A</code>s until we see a <code>B</code>. If our first
        machine state represents a state of "waiting to process an
        <code>A</code>", then the second machine state might represent a state
        of "waiting to process a <code>B</code>". In this state, whenever we see
        an <code>A</code>, we should do nothing to it and continue scanning to
        the right.
      </p>

      <p>
        This requires a transition from the second state back to itself. To add
        such a transition, select the second state, and click the "add self
        transition" button:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img class="img-sequence__item" src="./screenshots/add-self-transition-button.png" alt="The 'add self transition' button" />
      </div>

      <p>
        This will add a loop from the second state to itself, with the same
        inputs and arrow selector accompanying it:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img src="./screenshots/after-adding-self-transition.png" alt="After adding a self transition" />
      </div>

      <p>
        Since we want the machine to simply scan through any <code>A</code>s
        that it reads when following this transition, we will provide
        <code>A</code> as both the read and write symbol, and leave the tape
        movement direction as it is:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img src="./screenshots/complete-self-transition.png" alt="After completing a self transition" />
      </div>

      <p>
        The machine should now replace the first <code>A</code> it reads with an
        <code>a</code>, and then scan through any remaining <code>A</code>s. Try
        loading the tape with several <code>A</code>s, say <code>AAAA</code>, and
        stepping through the simulation:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/test-As.gif">
          <img src="./screenshots/test-As.gif" alt="Testing our machine so far" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        The machine is looking a little crowded; it would be nice if we could
        move the two transitions a little farther apart to reduce any potential
        confusion. Additionally, we are going to add several more states and it
        might be nice to make some room for them in advance. Fortunately,
        rearranging states and transition arrows is as simple as dragging and
        dropping with the mouse. To move a state, simply drag it; to move a
        group of states, select all of them (using SHIFT) and drag any one of
        the selected states; to move a transition arrow, drag the arrow
        associated with it.
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/movements.gif">
          <img src="./screenshots/movements.gif" alt="Rearranging the machine components" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        It's time to complete the core of the machine. Right now, the machine
        scans through every <code>A</code> it reads in the second state. We need
        to add a transition for it to follow when it reads a <code>B</code>.
        Furthermore, this transition must move the machine to an entirely new
        state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add a new state. Select the second state we added (the one that
        repeatedly scans through <code>A</code>s), then the new state, and add a
        transition between the two. This transition should have <code>B</code>
        as its read symbol, <code>b</code> as its write symbol, and the default
        leftward tape movement. Now, once we've replaced the first
        <code>B</code> by <code>b</code>, we need to again scan through any
        remaining <code>B</code>s. Add a self-transition to accomplish this.
        Your machine should now look like this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/after-adding-3-states.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/after-adding-3-states.png" alt="After adding a third state" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        Finally, we need to add some machinery to replace the first
        <code>C</code> we read with a <code>c</code>. However, after processing
        a <code>C</code>, we need to scan <i>backwards</i> to repeat the core
        process. Furthermore, we need to scan through any <code>c</code>s,
        <code>B</code>s, <code>b</code>s, and <code>A</code>s that might exist
        between the tape head and any leftmost remaining <code>A</code> symbol.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, add a new state and transition to replace the first
        <code>C</code> read with a <code>c</code>. Remember that the machine
        needs to move the tape to the <i>right</i> when following this
        transition. Your machine should now look like this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/replace-C.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/replace-C.png" alt="Enough machinery to replace C" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        To scan backwards to the leftmost <code>A</code>, we need to add a
        number of self-transitions (one for each symbol we might encounter).
        Begin by adding a self transition that scans through
        <code>c</code>s and moves the tape to the right. Then, hovering over
        this transition, click the <i>add new</i> button (or, simply add another
        self-transition). This will add an additional transition. Configure this
        one to scan through <code>B</code>s and move to the right. Add two more
        transitions in the same way: one for <code>b</code>s and another for
        <code>A</code>s. Your machine should look like this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/core-almost-complete.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/core-almost-complete.png" alt="The core nearly completed" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        At this point, we are nearly done with the core of the machine. We only
        need to add a transition from the last state we added to the first. The
        machine should follow this transition whenever it reads an
        <code>a</code>. It should leave this <code>a</code> as is, and move to
        the left, thus placing the tape head over the next <code>A</code>. From
        here, the process will continue as in the first case.
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/flawed-core.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/flawed-core.png" alt="The completed--but buggy--core" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        It is worth trying a few examples at this point. The core is complete,
        but there are two small errors that we need to fix. If the machine
        begins processing a second round of <code>A</code>s, <code>B</code>s,
        and <code>C</code>s, it gets stuck at the second state we added, because
        we haven't accounted for the fact that it needs to scan through any
        <code>b</code>s that were added in previous cycles. Likewise, we need to
        scan through any <code>c</code>s that we might encounter in the
        following state. After adding these two transitions, your machine should
        look like this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/completed-core.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/completed-core.png" alt="The completed core" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        Try stepping through an example string, or running the simulation
        continuously by clicking the "play" button. Here is a small clip of the
        latter:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/core-operations.gif">
          <img src="./screenshots/core-operations.gif" alt="A clip of the core operations, running" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        We are nearly done! Once we run out of <code>A</code>s to process, all
        that is left to do is verify that there are no remaining <code>B</code>s
        or <code>C</code>s on the tape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the machine returns to the initial state when it first reads
        an <code>a</code> after processing a <code>B</code> and a
        <code>C</code>. In a typical turn of the core loop, it will read an
        <code>A</code> immediately thereafter; however, when all of the
        <code>A</code>s have been processed, it will not read an <code>A</code>
        but a <code>b</code> instead. This is the sign that we are done
        processing <code>A</code>s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add a new state, and a transition to it from the initial state. This
        transition should be taken when the machine reads a <code>b</code> on
        the tape. Furthermore, in this state, the machine should scan through
        any <code>b</code>s on the tape, waiting for a <code>c</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add another state, and a transition to it from the state you just added.
        This one should be taken when the machine reads a <code>c</code>. In
        this state, the machine should scan through any <code>c</code>s on the
        tape.
      </p>

      <p>
        After adding the described machinery, your machine should resemble this:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/beginning-verification.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/beginning-verification.png" alt="The beginning of the verification process" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        Try loading the tape with an input string like <code>AABBCC</code> and
        pressing the "play" button (or trace its operations with the "step"
        button as we have been doing). The machine should reach the last state
        we added and then display an ominous message similar to the following:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/reject-message.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/reject-message.png" alt="The machine has rejected its input" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        When a machine has no transition to follow out of a state, it
        <i>halts</i> its operations. Its computation is now complete. But this
        is not the end of the story. A machine state can be designated as a
        &ldquo;final&rdquo; (or &ldquo;accepting&rdquo;) state. If the machine
        halts in a final state, it <i>accepts</i> its input; if it halts in a
        run-of-the-mill, non-final state, it <i>rejects</i> its input.
      </p>

      <p>
        This behavior and these terms are due to the fact that Turing machines
        (at least in their classical form) are designed to be <i>deciders</i>,
        meaning they answer questions of the form &ldquo;is <code>x</code> a
        string of some designated formal language/system?&rdquo; (of course,
        they can also change the contents of their tape, providing another
        output channel).
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to make our machine <i>accept</i> strings of the form
        <code>A<sup>n</sup>B<sup>n</sup>C<sup>n</sup></code>, we simply need to
        make the last state we added a final state. To do so, select the state,
        and click the "toggle state's status as final" button:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <img src="./screenshots/toggle-final-button.png" alt="The 'toggle state's status as final' button" />
      </div>

      <p>
        Try running the simulation again. This time, when the machine halts, the
        message should indicate that the input string was accepted:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/accepting.gif">
          <img src="./screenshots/accepting.gif" alt="The machine accepting its input" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        At this point, you should test a variety of input strings, especially
        ones that you suspect might be "tricky" to deal with. If you do so,
        you'll find that our machine contains a bug: not only does it accept
        strings of the form
        <code>A<sup>n</sup>B<sup>n</sup>C<sup>n</sup></code>, as we intend, but
        it also accepts strings of the form
        <code>A<sup>n</sup>B<sup>n</sup>C<sup>m</sup></code>, as long as
        <code>m</code> is at least as large as <code>n</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is due to the fact that when our machine reads the extraneous
        <code>C</code>s, it is already in a final state with nowhere to
        transition to, so it halts. To fix this, we simply need to provide an
        appropriate transition out of our final state to a non-final state. The
        machine should take this transition whenever it reads a <code>C</code>:
      </p>

      <div class="img-sequence">
        <a class="img-sequence__item" href="./screenshots/complete-machine.png">
          <img src="./screenshots/complete-machine.png" alt="The completed machine" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>
        The machine is now complete! Try constructing machines for some other
        formal languages, or tinkering with the one you just created. Can you
        make it accept strings of our language when <code>n</code> is 0 (i.e.
        the empty string)?
